## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Assessment Methodology

### Quantitative Risk Scoring

```
Inherent Risk = Base Severity √ó Likelihood
Residual Risk = Inherent Risk √ó (1 - Control Effectiveness)
Risk Reduction = Inherent Risk - Residual Risk
```

### Risk Matrix Framework

| Likelihood | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact | Critical Impact |
|------------|------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **High**   | Medium     | High          | Critical    | Critical        |
| **Medium** | Low        | Medium        | High        | Critical        |
| **Low**    | Low        | Low           | Medium      | High            |

### Control Effectiveness Levels

- **No Controls**: 0% effectiveness
- **Basic Controls**: 30% effectiveness
- **Standard Controls**: 60% effectiveness
- **Advanced Controls**: 85% effectiveness
