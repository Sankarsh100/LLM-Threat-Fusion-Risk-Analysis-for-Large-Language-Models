# LLM THREAT FUSION - QUICK REFERENCE CARD

## üéØ PROJECT ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)

"I developed a comprehensive security framework for Large Language Model deployments 
by synthesizing academic research, open-source intelligence, and industry frameworks. 
The project identified 12 critical threat vectors with CVSS scoring, created 228 
mitigation controls, and built an automated risk analysis tool. The framework 
demonstrates 60% risk reduction with standard controls and has been validated 
through real-world testing."
